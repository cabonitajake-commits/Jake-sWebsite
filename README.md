   <h1>About Mobile Legends:</h1>
   <img width="512" height="512" alt="unnamed" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22377f76-1dc7-490c-8127-dbfbb9fd6ba2" />
   <p style="font-size: 20px; border: 3px solid; margin: 3px;">The gameplay of Mobile Legends is built around classic MOBA elements. Players choose from a diverse roster of "heroes," each with unique abilities and playstyles, and are assigned to one of six main roles: Tank, Marksman, Assassin, Fighter, Mage, and Support. Each team works to destroy the enemy's base, which is protected by turrets along three lanes and a central jungle area filled with monsters. Victory requires a blend of individual skill, strategic teamwork, and objective control. The fast-paced nature of the game, with matchmaking often taking seconds and a typical match lasting around 10 to 15 minutes, makes it an ideal choice for quick gaming sessions.</p>
